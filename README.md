## 1. Difficulties ##
There are four difficulty options in the game. The first three: easy, medium and hard, follow the regular sudoku game rules. The bigger difficulty option, the more advanced techniques are used to generate the grids. 
All allow for 3 mistakes.

The fourth difficulty is called "big" - it is not a typical 9x9 sudoku game, but rather a 16x16 game that's generated using the same techniques as the games of hard difficulty. This difficulty allows for 4 mistakes.

## 2. Controls ##
Select the cells by clicking on them. You can only select the cells which are empty.

Fill the cells on the grid by pressing keys on the keyboard: 1-9 (numpad is fine too) for 9x9 games, and additionally A-G (alphabetical) for 16x16 games. 

Incorrect guesses are indicated by the red color of the inserted character. To empty the cell, select it (if not already selected) and press backspace key.

Use hint button (indicated by the lightbulb icon) on an empty cell to get a hint. You can only use one hint per game. Use pencil marks button (indicated by the pencil icon) to turn on the pencil marks mode. It will 
allow you to mark potential correct guesses in the selected cell (also by pressing the appropriate keys on the keyboard). Click on the pencil marks button again to quit the pencil marks mode.

After losing the game, click "retry" to play the same game again. After winning or losing, you can play a new game.
